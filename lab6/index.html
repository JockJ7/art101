		<h2> Challenge </h2>
		<p>I had trouble understanding task 1 and what was the code that was required to write it down.</p>
		<h2> Problems </h2>
		<p> The main problem I had was getting the image to show up in my code. Which is a main problem with my other labs.</p>
		<h2> Results </h2>
		<p> In the end, I was able to work with my partner and complete the lab. </p>
